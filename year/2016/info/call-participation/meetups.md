We invite you to submit proposals for informal meetups on all topics related to visualization, including scientific visualization, information visualization, visual analytics, and application areas.

Meetups (previously known as BOFs) are an excellent forum to discuss a wide range of topics related to visualization. For example, if you are an experienced researcher, consider submitting a proposal to share your knowledge in an informal setting with conference participants. Proposals devoted to a particular discipline's methods and cross disciplinary proposals are both welcome. For example, some recent meetups have included opportunities to discuss topics related to blogging about visualization, the BioVis contest, and the connection between art and science.

VIS2016 is eager to expand its Meetup sessions and will consider proposals given room availability. Meetups are public and open to all attendees. Meetup organizers need to register at the conference.

A meetup proposal should include:

* a title,
* a responsible person (name, contact information),
* a brief description of the topic to be addressed,
* prospective audience,
* a foreseen number of participants,
* room equipment requirements and,
* preferences and constraints for meetup schedule (if applicable).

The proposal should be no longer than one page in total.

Meetup proposals should be sent to the Meetup Chairs at [meetups@ieeevis.org](mailto:meetups@ieeevis.org).

Impromptu meetups: We also encourage impromptu meetups to be organized during the conference itself. Please contact the chairs by email or in person during the conference in order to secure a conference room and time slot.
