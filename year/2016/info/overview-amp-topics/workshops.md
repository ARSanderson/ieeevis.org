It is clear that modern scientific discovery requires a new data-intensive approach. Vast stores of data available - from experiments, observations and simulations - have the potential to enable countless valuable new discoveries, yet scientists continue to struggle to make sense of their data. Like many IEEE VIS attendees, we believe visualization holds an answer to this problem, but we also believe that something new, perhaps even disruptive, needs to happen in order to realize this potential. Borrowing from successes we see in the computer games community, we propose the concept of a Discovery Jam as an exciting, vibrant, inspirational mechanism for bringing new interdisciplinary teams together to address specific challenge problems while demonstrating - through example - a culture of collaboration and training a new cohort of scientists, technologists, and artists to work together toward discovery across disciplines. The Discovery Jam will bring scientists to the VisWeek conference, to present their difficult, high-impact science discovery problems to the experts in the vis community. The Discovery Jam will live on after VisWeek, through an online community fostered at http://www.discoveryjam.com.

The pedagogy of data visualization is becoming increasingly important as data visualization techniques and tools proliferate. In this workshop, we propose to create a community of practice that supports each other as they learn to be better teachers in their respective classrooms. Based on the well attended panels at IEEE Vis in 2010 and 2015, there is a strong interest in the data visualization community for exploring the pedagogy of data visualization. We propose the conduct a half-day interactive workshop that will include lightning talks followed by a discussion on strategies to further sustain the community of practice of data visualization educators.

There is a growing interest in eye tracking as a research method in many communities, including information visualization, scientific visualization, visual analytics, but also in human-computer interaction, applied perception, psychology, cognitive science, security, and mixed reality. Progress in hardware technology and the reduction of costs for eye tracking devices have made this analysis technique accessible to a large population of researchers. Recording the observer's gaze can reveal how dynamic graphical displays are visually accessed and which information are processed in real time. Nonetheless, standardized practices for technical implementations and data interpretation remain unresolved. With this second Workshop on Eye Tracking and Visualization (ETVIS), we intend to follow-up on the highly successful first ETVIS Workshop (at IEEE VIS 2015) and continue to build a community of eye tracking researchers within the visualization community, covering information visualization, scientific visualization, and visual analytics. We also aim to establish connections to related fields, in particular, in human-computer interaction, cognitive science, and psychology. This will promote a robust exchange of established practices and innovative use scenarios.

The recent ATI (Alan Turing Institute) [Symposium on Theoretical Foundation of Visual Analytics](https://sites.google.com/site/drminchen/home/events) identiﬁed four aspects of research activities that may contribute directly to the development of a theoretical foundation for Visualization and Visual Analytics. These include taxonomies, principles and guidelines, conceptual frameworks and models, and quantitative laws. In particular, attendees estimated that there could be some 500 principles and guidelines in visualization and visual analytics. These include well-known principles (e.g., “overview ﬁrst, details on demand” and “data-ink ratio”), numerous guidelines collected in surveys, resulted from empirical studies, and proposed based on application experience, and many wise-sayings spread through word of mouth. The meeting identified a number of challenges, including: i) the lack of a centralized place for easy discovery of known or proposed principles and guidelines; ii) the lack of documentation about when and where a principle or guideline is applicable and when and where it is not, as well as examples for attesting either conditions; and iii) the lack of platforms (except formal publications) for supporting the evolution and improvement of principles and guidelines. The primary goal of this workshop is to create a first of its kind event were: (a) to present these challenges to the Visualization and Visual Analytics community; (b) to encourage the discussions of principles and guidelines in an open, democratic, and evidence-based manner; (c) to foster and facilitate the creation, curation, critique and conditioning (i.e., education, training and deployment) of Principles and Guidelines in Visualization.

A growing number of visualization tools are now publicly released on the Web. While this has many benefits, such as reaching more users without any installation time or procedure, it is often unclear how those tools are being used. The most common method to remotely observe usage is remote logging through a web server. Analyzing recorded logs has already been successful to improve the usability of tools, assess the performance of users and even to enrich the user interface with histories or logs visualizations. However, from our own practice of recording and analyzing logs, we have found a lack of methodology to support this process and use the results consistently. This workshop aims at bringing the visualization community together to share their practice on logging mechanisms, methods, logs reporting, analysis, visualization, and the underlying infrastructure to support logging on the server side and on the client side. Expected benefits include raising awareness on the potentials of logging for visualization, providing shared tools and methods to instrument visualizations, show how logging can improve visualization and interaction techniques, and scale to large number of users and sessions.

Despite the growing popularity of digital methods for research in the humanities, digital humanists are under-served by academics in visualization, and underrepresented in visualization conferences. This is due to a number of factors: 1) The differences in rhetorics of proof and discovery (and so differences in data culture and use) in the humanities as opposed to scientific or other analytic fields. 2) The difficulty of performing task analysis and evaluation for many humanities questions, which may have no ground truth. 3) In text visualization specifically, the difference between the needs of digital humanists (who perform close readings and critical engagements with texts) as opposed to more standard text vis scenarios (e.g. text analytics on datasets for intelligence or social media analysis).

Addressing these difficulties requires exposure of these data issues, interdisciplinary collaboration, and steering of future research directions. To those ends, we propose a workshop, co-located at IEEE VIS, focused on emerging visualization research in the digital humanities. The purpose of this workshop is to propose new research directions in visualization for the digital humanities, to familiarize the visualization research community with the problems faced by digital humanities researchers, and to foster future collaboration between visualization and digital humanities research communities.

As visualization researchers, our ongoing challenge is often to leverage the voluminous data that is being captured to drive decision making and insights. Common to such data are temporal events, data points with both a timestamp and event type, so understanding patterns of temporal event sequences is an important problem to many domains. For example, medical researchers may wish to leverage the data captured by electronic health records to determine if certain sequences of medical events correlate with positive outcomes. Similarly, city government officials may wish to leverage the temporal data collected from their transportation systems, call centers, and law enforcement agencies to improve their cities’ services. Engineers might analyze temporal events from system logs to manage large-scale distributed system performance. Consumer services analysts might seek to understand social media and shopping patterns.

Recently, there has been an increasing amount of visualization research focusing on temporal events. The main question behind the proposed workshop is: how can we unify and advance the role of visualization in temporal event analysis?

The main goal of the workshop is to gather visualization researchers together to discuss the interesting opportunities and challenges visualization may face with temporal events. We want to be able to gather the existing literature on the subject and build a research agenda for future research.

The workshop's primary goal is to provide a forum in which visualization practitioners from outside the classical VIS community and researchers from within can meet. To this end, this workshop will target the practical application of VIS technology to solve real-world problems. The overarching theme of these discussions will be the current state-of-the-art in open source solutions for visualization and visual analytics. We will solicit two types of submissions. The first will be submissions which describe the motivation, design, and implementation of recent open source visualization systems. The second will be submissions that describe the application of open source visualization tools to domain specific problems and lessons learned. All submissions will be evaluated on their potential impact on both the practitioner and research segments of the visualization community. The planned program will allow participants to expand their visualization toolbox and incorporate solutions to common visualization problems that are tried-and-tested under real-world conditions.
