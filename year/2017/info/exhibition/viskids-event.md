Besides [child care grants](./viskids-child-care-grants),
VISKids 2017 expands its offerings
by providing a permanent meeting room and organizing activities.

The activities and the room are *open to everyone,* not just awardees of the child care grant program.


### VISKids Room

Throughout the duration of the conference,
VISKids will have a room for meetings, discussions,
and personal considerations.
It will feature chairs, tables, and room dividers (poster walls)
to provide privacy.

- **Location:** tba

### VISKids Hello

At the beginning of the conference,
we will have a short gathering
to inform about the VISKids grants and activities.
The VISKids co-chairs will answer all questions.
Everyone is welcome.

- **Location:** VISKids Room
- **Time:** tba


### VISParents Meetup

Whether you are a new parent, expectant parent, experienced wise parent, or considering some day to be a parent, come attend the first VISParents meet-up to discuss work-life balance topics at VIS.  In this open roundtable conversation topics will include work-life balance in general, going into academia versus industry, balancing time with your VISKid, going on paternity leave, being a VISParent while completing your dissertation as a student, and being a VISParent while trying to achieve tenure as a professor.  Please come share your wisdom and experiences in this open supportive VIS environment.  VISKids are also welcome to attend.

- **Location:** VISKids Room
- **Time:** tba


### _Dear Data_ Studio

VISKids and VISAP jointly present a special activity of the [VIS capstone speaker](../../capstone) **Giorgia Lupi**.

Giorgia is co-author of _Dear Data_, an inspirational hand drawn data visualization book.
She brings the spirit of this book to VIS in a live participatory visualization session.
The audience will be asked to manually visualize data (draw!)
following the visual language of different abstract paintings.
Giorgia will guide the process.

- **Location:** tba
- **Time:** tba
