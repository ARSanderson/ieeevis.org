<p><strong>Data Humanism - The Revolution will be Visualized
</strong><br /> <br /> 
It’s time to change our minds about data. Data is often perceived as inevitably cold, but instead it can be more than numbers, it can represent real life and it can be a snapshot of the world in the same way that a picture catches small moments in time.   The more ubiquitous data becomes, the more we need to experiment with how to make it unique, contextual, intimate; and the way we visualize it is crucial as it is  the key to translating numbers into concepts we can relate to. In an aspirational talk, Giorgia will discuss how to see this moment as an  opportunity to jumpstart a new renaissance, where we can question the  impersonality of a merely technical approach to data, where we are ready to reconnect numbers to what they really stand for: which are more and more our lives. </p>
