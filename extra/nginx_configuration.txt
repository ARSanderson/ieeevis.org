As of jekyll 3.1.2, all webpages are always generated with the full
extension. This is annoying and makes it hard to support legacy
URLs. The way I'm working around this is by setting up the correct
rules at the server side. Specifically, I'm using nginx and:

server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;
        server_name ieeevis.cscheid.net;
	
        index index.html index.htm;
	disable_symlinks off;
	default_type text/html;
	
	location / {
		root /home/cscheid/code/ieeevis.org/jekyll/_site;
		try_files $uri.html $uri $uri/ =404;
	}
}
