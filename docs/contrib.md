# Contributing

Thank you for helping with the vis website. The easiest way for you to
contribute to the website is to edit the file directly in your
browser. What will happen behind the scenes after you're done with an
edit is that GitHub will automatically create a "pull request" from
your edit, which will let us know that you would like to update some
of the
content. [Here](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)
is a simple guide.

## Who's responsible for what?

The point-of-contact for each page in the website is the
`contact` person in each page's front matter. If a page does not have
an assigned contact, then 1) that's possibly a bug that should be
reported, 2) `web@ieeevis.org` is the default point-of-contact.

This means that if you found a bug on the *content* of a webpage,
you're welcome to create a pull request for the content to get
fixed. However, if the fix involves anything more than trivial typos,
we will wait for an OK from the point-of-contact before committing the
changes.

## What's with the content files all over the place?

This is the result of five years of legacy pages written atop of each
other. We're slowly improving the situation, but the legacy content is
currently quite messy. Pull requests are welcome.
